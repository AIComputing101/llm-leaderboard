## 📝 Additional Notes

"Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer". C4 + NLP language problems. "compared the following three configurations: First, the standard baseline model, which was pre-trained on 235 ≈ 34B tokens; second, the baseline trained instead for about 1 trillion tokens (i.e. the same amount of pre-training used for T5), which we refer to as “baseline-1T”; and third, T5-Base."

Multimodal. 50B param estimate based on "Mistral Medium 3 can also be deployed on any cloud, including self-hosted environments of four GPUs and above.". Note: "With the launches of Mistral Small in March and Mistral Medium today, it’s no secret that we’re working on something ‘large’ over the next few weeks. With even our medium-sized model being resoundingly better than flagship open source models such as Llama 4 Maverick, we’re excited to ‘open’ up what’s to come :) "

## 📝 Additional Notes

"Evo 2 is a state of the art DNA language model for long context modeling and design. Evo 2 models DNA sequences at single-nucleotide resolution at up to 1 million base pair context length using the StripedHyena 2 architecture. Evo 2 was pretrained using Savanna. Evo 2 was trained autoregressively on OpenGenome2, a dataset containing 8.8 trillion tokens from all domains of life." Greg Brockman co-author.

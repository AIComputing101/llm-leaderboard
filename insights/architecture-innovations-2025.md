## Overview

This document tracks the latest architectural innovations and patterns emerging in modern Large Language Models (LLMs) as of 2025. While the fundamental transformer architecture remains consistent, models are incorporating incremental improvements focused on inference efficiency and parameter activation strategies.

## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)

MoE architectures replace single feedforward blocks with multiple expert layers, allowing models to activate only a subset of parameters per token.

**Benefits:**
- Reduced inference computational costs
- Increased model capacity without proportional compute increase
- Better specialization across different domains

**Notable Implementations:**
- **DeepSeek V3**: MoE with shared expert architecture
- **Qwen3**: Offers both dense and MoE variants
- See full [MoE Models list](../architectures/moe.md)

**Related Models in Leaderboard:**
- [DeepSeek-R2](../models/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r2.md) - Rank #4 by ALScore
- [Qwen3-Max](../models/alibaba/qwen3-max.md) - Rank #16 by ALScore
- [Grok-3](../models/xai/grok-3.md) - Rank #18 by ALScore

### 2. Attention Mechanism Innovations

Modern LLMs experiment with various attention patterns to improve efficiency and performance:

#### Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)
- **Used by**: DeepSeek V3
- **Benefit**: Reduced memory bandwidth and improved efficiency
- **Status**: Cutting-edge innovation

#### Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)
- **Adoption**: Widespread across modern models
- **Benefit**: Reduces KV cache size during inference
- **Trade-off**: Slight accuracy vs. efficiency balance

#### Sliding Window Attention
- **Used by**: Gemma 3
- **Benefit**: Efficient handling of long contexts
- **Application**: Extended sequence processing

#### Gated Attention
- **Status**: Emerging pattern
- **Benefit**: Improved control over information flow
- **Use case**: Selective attention mechanisms

### 3. Normalization Techniques

**RMSNorm Variations:**
- Pre-Norm configurations (most common)
- Post-Norm configurations
- Placement variations across layers

**QK-Norm (Query-Key Normalization):**
- Normalizes query and key vectors in attention
- Improves training stability
- Increasingly adopted in newer models

### 4. Advanced Training Innovations

**Multi-Token Prediction:**
- **Used by**: gpt-oss
- **Benefit**: Improved training efficiency
- **Method**: Predicting multiple tokens simultaneously

**Attention Bias:**
- Fine-tuned biasing mechanisms
- Improved context handling
- Better long-range dependencies
